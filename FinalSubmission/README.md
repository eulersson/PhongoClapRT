# Phongo Clap RT

![](https://github.com/eulersson/PhongoClapRT/raw/master/FinalSubmission/sample_images/colorful.png)
*... see documentation: http://ramonblanquer.com/doc/phongo/index.html*

## Brief
My project consists on a raytracing offline renderer. This is what I handed in but I will be extending it to features
like path tracing. A full list about the further things I would like to do are listed after the usage section. My
raytracer features:

* Sphere-Ray Intersections
* Plane-Ray Intersections
* Lighting decay
* Raytraced Shadows
* Reflection
* Refraction
* Phong Shading Model
* Antialiasing
* File parsing

## Usage
Its usage is fairly simple. You just have to run the binary followed by the path where the scene file is located. Read
carefully how the syntax works on the next section because it is not particulary straight-forward due to my lack of
knowledge with parsing frameworks.
```
./clap [path to scene text file]
```
I recommend building your binary from source code to make sure that it will work on your system. For that you will need
**qmake** and **git**. If you want to try Phongo Clap on your computer run these commands. However I also include a
previously built binary just in case.

```
git clone https://github.com/eulersson/PhongoClapRT
cd PhongoClapRT/FinalSubmission
qmake
make
./clap scene_file.txt
```

## Scene File Syntax
**Please read this section carefully.** I would first suggest you to take a look at a sample image file that I included
with the project. Scene files consist on three parts: a **header**, the **lights interface** and the **objects interface**.

### Scene File Sample [scene_file.txt]

```
NAME "colorful" DIMENSIONS ["500" "500"]
CAMERA ["0", "1", "-2"] ["0", "0", "6"]
DEPTH "4" ANTI-ALIASING "4"

Lights
{
    +light1 [ 5 5 3 ] [ 0.347 0.89 0.78 ] [ 0.347 0.89 0.78 ] 2 2 1
    +light2 [ -5 5 4.2 ] [ 1 1 1 ] [ 1 1 1 ] 2 2 1
    +light3 [ 0.9 2 -1 ] [ 1 1 1 ] [ 1 1 1 ] 0.2 0.2 1

+}

Objects
{
    $Plane plane1 -1 [ 0 1 0 ] @checker [ 0 0 0 ] [ 1 1 1 ] @specularHardness 4

    $Plane plane2 -4.90 [ 0 1 -1 ] [ 1 1 0 ] /

    $Sphere sphere1 [ 0 0 2 ] 0.8 [ 1 0 1 ] @specularHardness 5

    $Sphere sphere2 [ -1 1.2 0.2 ] 0.5 [ 0.1 0.4 0.95 ] @reflective 70

    $Sphere sphere4 [ 1.1 0.5 2.0 ] 0.1 [ 0 1 0 ] @refractive 1.2 100

    $Sphere sphere5 [ 0.7 0.95 0.3 ] 0.15 [ 1 1 0 ] @specularHardness 100

    $Sphere sphere6 [ 1.1 0 4.0 ] 0.1 [ 0.2 1 0.14 ] @specularHardness 100

    $Sphere sphere7 [ -0.9 0.15 0.8 ] 0.3 [ 1 0 0 ] @refractive 1.2 100

    $Sphere sphere8 [ 0.5 0.3 0.2 ] 0.2 [ 0 0.8 1 ] @refractive 1.2 100

    $Sphere sphere9 [ 0.3 1.4 3.2 ] 0.53 [ 1 0.4 0.2 ] @reflective 60
$}


```

### Header
The header part contains the information about what the name of the project is, the dimensions, camera, depth and
antialiasing. Each property consists of `VARIABLE "VALUE"` or `VARIABLE ["VALUE" "VALUE"]`. And they need to be
declared as follows. Please copy and paste this to your text file to avoid problems and simply change the values.

```
NAME "fileName" DIMENSIONS ["width" "height"]
CAMERA ["posX", "posY", "posZ"] ["aimX", "aimY", "aimZ"]
DEPTH "recursive_depth" ANTI-ALIASING "aa"
```
* *replace the lowercase words with values, leaving the quotes " "*

For the lights interface each light declaration and definition should be started by `+`, and everything should be wrapped
as `Lights { [all the lights] +}` (*do't forget the `+` before the closing brace*). The definition follows this pattern:

```
+light_name [ posX posY posZ ] [ diffR diffG diffB ] [ specR specG specB ] diffInt specInt falloff
```

**PLEASE note that the first and last values of each tuple are seppared using a SPACE, if you do it like
[posX posY posZ] it will break, same if you do it like [ posX posY posZ].**

Where
* `light_name` is self-explanatory
* `posX`, `posY`, and `posZ` refer to the light's position.
* `diffR`, `diffG`, `diffB` *[0-1] value* refer to the diffuse colour.
* `specR`, `specG`, `specB` *[0-1] value* refer to the specular colour.
* `diffInt` the amount of diffuse contribution emmited by the light.
* `specInt` amount of specular the light emits.
* `falloff` decay amount.

Here there is an example:

```
Lights
{
    +light1 [ 5 5 3 ] [ 0.347 0.89 0.78 ] [ 0.347 0.89 0.78 ] 2 2 1
    +light2 [ -5 5 4.2 ] [ 1 1 1 ] [ 1 1 1 ] 2 2 1
    +light3 [ 0.9 2 -1 ] [ 1 1 1 ] [ 1 1 1 ] 0.2 0.2 1
+}
```

The object interface is similar. Everything is between `Objects { [...] $}` **(do not forget dollar sign before closing
brace)**. We can declare either planes or spheres.

### Planes
A plane can be of two types, a **checkerboard plane** or a regular plane. To define a **regular plane** do it as follows:

```
$Plane plane_name dist [ nX nY nZ ] [ cR cG cB ]
```

**PLEASE note that the first and last values of each tuple are seppared using a SPACE, if you do it like
[nX nY nZ] it will break, same if you do it like [ nX nY nZ].**

Where
* `plane_name` is self explanatory.
* `dist` is the distance from the origin.
* `nX, nY, nZ` *(no need to normalize, it's done for you)* are the normal components of the plane.
* `cR`, `cG`, `cB` *[0-1] values* are the colour components of the plane.

For a **checkerboard** plane the definition is a bit different:

```
$Plane plane_name dist [ nX nY nZ ] @checker [ col1R col1G col1B ] [ col2R col2G col2B ]
```

Take a look at the **@checker** token. after the checker token the parser will be expecting two tuples of colours, do
it as above, **putting spaces even before the first element of the tuple**.

You can set the plane to have certain **specular** hardness by the keyword `@specularHardness [value]`. Find some examples
above.

### Spheres
Spheres are pretty simple.

```
$Sphere sphere_name [ cX cY cZ ] rad [ colR colG colB ]
```

Where
* `cX`, `cY`, `cZ` are the world space coordinates of the sphere centres.
* `rad` is the radius of the sphere.
* `colR`, `colG`, `colB` are the colour values of the sphere.

##### Reflection
You can set reflection options using the keyword `@reflective percentage` where the percentage will determine
how reflective the sphere is.
##### Refraction
Refraction settings are set `@refraction index_of_refraction transparency` where transparency is in %.
##### Sphecular hardness
Also you can set specular hardness for the objects that are not reflective or refractive. I did it that way
because I did a trick to make the transparent/reflective objects look glossy. So if you use specular
hardness **you cannot use reflection or refraction**.

You have to stick to this structure.

<p>... rendering with anti-aliasing value of 16</p>

<img src ="https://github.com/eulersson/PhongoClapRT/raw/master/FinalSubmission/sample_images/interstellar.png" width="500" height="500" align="center" />
<p>... this happens if I don't clamp the light contributions to [0-1]</p>

<img src ="https://github.com/eulersson/PhongoClapRT/raw/master/FinalSubmission/sample_images/pink.png" width="500" height="500" align="center" />
<p>... same here. Not clamping the values produces interesting results!</p>

<img src ="https://github.com/eulersson/PhongoClapRT/raw/master/FinalSubmission/sample_images/simple_phong.png" width="500" height="500" align="center" />
<p>... first tests when I implemented the Phong shader and tweaked it.</p>

<img src ="https://github.com/eulersson/PhongoClapRT/raw/master/FinalSubmission/sample_images/colorful.png" width="500" height="500" align="center" />
<p>... my favourite render. The scene_file I include renders this.</p>
